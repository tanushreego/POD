Programmer Rank
===============
A university conducts a number of programming contests in their programming portal every day. The problems given in the portal are categorized into easy, medium and hard. A student scores 10 points when he solves an easy problem, he gets 30 points when solves a medium level problem and he scores 50 points when he solves a hard problem. The university decides to give a ranking for the students based on their active performance in the contests. Students with the highest score get the first rank, the second highest score gets the second rank and so on. If more than one student, say ‘k’ students get the same score then all get the same rank ‘r’ and the next student or students get ‘r+k’ th rank. For example, when there are six students with the following details:
