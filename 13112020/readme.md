Largest Factor Among Left Rotated Numbers
=========================================
Given a four digit number ‘n’, find the largest factor among the left rotated numbers. Here left rotated numbers of a number ‘n’ is formed by rotating ‘n’ left 1 to 3 times. For example, if n is 2456, then when it is rotated once we get 4562, when it is rotated twice we get 5624 and when it is rotated thrice we get 6245. Factors of these numbers are

2456 - 1, 2, 4, 8, 307, 614, 1228

4562 - 1, 2, 2281

5624 - 1, 2, 4, 8, 19, 37, 38, 74, 76, 148, 152, 296, 703, 1406, 2812

6245 - 1, 5, 1249

The largest factor is 2812 and left rotated number with this factor is 5624.

Note: Read the input as integer and do entire processing as integer
