CHICKEN PROBLEM
========

In a small poultry farm there are three enclosures. There are odd number of chickens in the farm and each enclosure can contain odd number of chickens only. Second enclosure is larger than the first enclosure and third enclosure is larger than the second enclosure. Given the total number of chickens ‘n’ in the poultry farm and the minimum number of chickens that can be put in the first enclosure, ‘m’, write a code to print all possible ways in which the chickens can be kept.

For example, if the total number of chicken in the farm is 27 and the minimum number of chickens that can be kept in first enclosure is 3 there are seven ways to keep the chickens as shown below:

3 5 19

3 7 17

3 9 15

3 11 13

5 7 15

5 9 13

7 9 11

If the ‘n’ chickens cannot be kept with minimum number of ‘m’ chickens in the first enclosure, then print ‘No way’. For example, if number of chicken in the poultry farm is 11 and minimum number of chickens to be kept in first enclosure is 3 then print ‘No way’
